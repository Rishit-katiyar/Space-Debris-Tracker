## Introduction

Space debris, also known as space junk, poses a significant threat to satellites and spacecraft in orbit around Earth. This project aims to mitigate this threat by providing a system to track and monitor space debris in real-time. The Space Debris Tracker utilizes computer vision algorithms to detect and track debris objects in video streams captured by telescopes.

## Features

- Real-time tracking of space debris.
- Interactive menu-driven interface.
- Visualization of detected debris on video frames.
- Saving debris data to CSV files.
- Plotting debris counts per frame.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the Space Debris Tracker on your system:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rishit-katiyar/Space-Debris-Tracker.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Space-Debris-Tracker
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Install the required Python packages using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Run the Tracker**:
   - Start the tracking system by running the main script:
     ```bash
     python space_debris_tracker.py
     ```

## Usage

Once the Space Debris Tracker is running, you can interact with it through the menu-driven interface. Here are the available options:

1. **Toggle Visualization**: Toggle the visualization of detected debris on video frames.
2. **Save Debris Data**: Save debris data to a CSV file.
3. **Plot Debris Counts**: Plot the count of debris per frame.
4. **Set Min Area**: Set the minimum area threshold for detecting debris.
5. **Set Max Area**: Set the maximum area threshold for detecting debris.
6. **Exit**: Stop the tracking system and exit the program.
